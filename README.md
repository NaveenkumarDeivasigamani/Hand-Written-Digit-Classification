# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification
This is the project "Hand Written Digit Prediction" is done by using Machine Learning Techniques for YBI foundation Internship. 
# What is handwritten digit prediction?
The Handwritten Digit Recognition is the ability of the computers to recognize the human handwritten digits. With the help of the dataset, this allows the model to analyze and predict the outcome of the number fed into the model with various flavors of the handwriting available.
